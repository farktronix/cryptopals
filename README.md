Cryptopals Solutions
==========

These are my solutions to the [cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com) cryptography challenges. I'm using this as an excuse to learn Swift while I learn more about crypto.

This code was written for fun and education and isn't meant to be a reference or canonical solution to the problems. Most of the solutions are really inefficient because I'm still trying to learn the Swift Way of doing things.
